# Code Converters in Digital Electronics (DE) — A Detailed Guide

This guide explains what digital “codes” are, why we convert between them, and how to design code converter circuits step-by-step. It covers the most common converters you’ll encounter in Digital Electronics: Binary ↔ Gray, BCD (8421) ↔ Excess-3, and briefly touches other numeric codes. You’ll learn both the theory and practical gate-level design techniques (truth tables, K-maps, and minimal logic), along with implementation tips and pitfalls.

## 1) What is a “code” in DE?

A code is a way to represent information (typically numbers or characters) using bits. Different codes optimize for different goals:
- Reliability (minimize errors during transitions)
- Ease of arithmetic and complements
- Hardware simplicity (fewer gates, simple wiring)
- Human-readability or display convenience

Common classifications:
- Weighted codes: Bit positions carry weights, e.g. BCD (8421) where weights are 8, 4, 2, 1.
- Non-weighted codes: Bits don’t have fixed positional weights, e.g. Gray code (cyclic code).
- Self-complementing codes: 9’s complement obtainable by bitwise complement, e.g. Excess-3.
- Alphanumeric codes: ASCII, EBCDIC for characters (less common in basic DE code converter topics).

---

## 2) Why do we need code converters?

- Interfacing modules using different codes (sensors, encoders, display drivers)
- Improving robustness (Gray code reduces multi-bit transitions)
- Facilitating certain arithmetic properties (Excess-3 simplifies complement logic)
- Converting for display (BCD ↔ 7-segment drivers)

Code converters are combinational circuits: outputs depend only on current inputs (no memory). Typical design steps:
1. Define input/output codes and bit widths.
2. Build a truth table mapping each input to the desired output.
3. Derive Boolean equations per output bit using Karnaugh Maps (K-maps) or algebra.
4. Implement using logic gates (XOR, AND, OR, NOT) or arithmetic blocks (adders).
5. Verify for all valid inputs; decide behavior for invalid inputs.

## 3) Gray Code: Binary ↔ Gray

### 3.1 Overview
- Gray code is a cyclic binary code where consecutive numeric values differ by exactly one bit, in which every successive pair of numbers differs by only one bit.
-  This is crucial in mechanical/optical encoders and asynchronous transitions, minimizing errors from partial changes.
- It is used in applications in which the normal sequence of binary numbers generated by the hardware, is read while the system changes from the initial state to the final state.
- This could have serious consequences for the machine using the information.
- The Gray code eliminates this problem since only one bit changes its value during any transition between two numbers.

#### Another Name of Gray Code

Unity Hamming Distance Code
Cyclic Code
Reflecting Code

Properties:
- Non-weighted, cyclic.
- Consecutive codes differ by one bit (Hamming distance 1).
- Ideal for position encoders, rotary dials, A/D stepping sequences.

### 3.2 Binary → Gray (n-bit)
Let binary bits be b[n−1]...b[0] (MSB to LSB). Gray bits g[n−1]...g[0] are:
- g[n−1] = b[n−1]
- For i from n−2 down to 0: g[i] = b[i+1] ⊕ b[i]

Equivalently (indexing from MSB to LSB):
- g0 = b0
- gi = bi ⊕ b(i−1) for i ≥ 1  (if you number bits left-to-right)

Hardware: A simple XOR network
- One wire for MSB
- Chain of XORs for the rest

#### Truth Table

| Binary (b3 b2 b1 b0) | Gray (g3 g2 g1 g0) |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 0000 | 0000 |
| 0001 | 0001 |
| 0010 | 0011 |
| 0011 | 0010 |
| 0100 | 0110 |
| 0101 | 0111 |
| 0110 | 0101 |
| 0111 | 0100 |
| 1000 | 1100 |
| 1001 | 1101 |
| 1010 | 1111 |
| 1011 | 1110 |
| 1100 | 1010 |
| 1101 | 1011 |
| 1110 | 1001 |
| 1111 | 1000 |

#### Key Observation
- Only **one bit changes** between consecutive Gray code values.
- This minimizes **transition errors** in digital systems.

#### Generalized Boolean Expression for conversion of Binary to Gray Code
Boolean expression for conversion of binary to gray code for n-bit :

```
gn = bn 

gn-1 = bn XOR bn-1 : : 

g1 = b2 XOR b1 

```

#### Minimized Boolean Expressions and Digital Circuit for Gray Code Bits

g0 ​= b0​b1′ ​+ b1​b0′ ​= b0 ​⊕ b1​
g1 ​= b2​b1′ ​+ b1​b2′ ​= b1 ​⊕ b2​
g2 ​= b2​b3′ ​+ b3​b2′ ​= b2​ ⊕ b3​
g3 ​= b3

Example (4-bit):
- b = 1011
- g0 = 1
- g1 = 0 ⊕ 1 = 1
- g2 = 1 ⊕ 0 = 1
- g3 = 1 ⊕ 1 = 0
- g = 1110

### 3.3 Gray → Binary (n-bit)
- b[n−1] = g[n−1]
- For i from n−2 down to 0: b[i] = b[i+1] ⊕ g[i]

  
#### Truth Table

| Gray (g3 g2 g1 g0) | Binary (b3 b2 b1 b0) |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| 0000 | 0000 |
| 0001 | 0001 |
| 0011 | 0010 |
| 0010 | 0011 |
| 0110 | 0100 |
| 0111 | 0101 |
| 0101 | 0110 |
| 0100 | 0111 |
| 1100 | 1000 |
| 1101 | 1001 |
| 1111 | 1010 |
| 1110 | 1011 |
| 1010 | 1100 |
| 1011 | 1101 |
| 1001 | 1110 |
| 1000 | 1111 |

#### Key Observation
- Binary code is recovered using **cumulative XOR** starting from the MSB.
- The conversion is **fully reversible**.

#### One-Line Note
> **Gray to Binary conversion uses cumulative XOR, where each binary bit depends on the previous binary bit and the current Gray bit.**


#### Generalized Boolean Expression for conversion of Gray to Binary Code
Boolean expression for conversion of binary to gray code for n-bit :

```
b_n = g_n  

b_{n-1} = b_n ⊕ g_{n-1}  

b_{n-2} = b_{n-1} ⊕ g_{n-2}  

⋮  

b_1 = b_2 ⊕ g_1  

b_0 = b_1 ⊕ g_0  
```

#### Minimized Boolean Expressions and Digital Circuit for Gray Code Bits

b3 = g3
b2 = b3 ⊕ g2
b1 = b2 ⊕ g1
b0 = b1 ⊕ g0

Example (4-bit):
- g = 1110
- b0 = 1
- b1 = 1 ⊕ 1 = 0
- b2 = 0 ⊕ 1 = 1
- b3 = 1 ⊕ 0 = 1
- b = 1011

Design tip: Gray converters are best implemented with XOR gates; K-maps are not necessary because the XOR relationship is canonical.

## 4) BCD (8421) ↔ Excess-3 (XS-3)

### 4.1 BCD (8421)
BCD encodes each decimal digit (0–9) into a 4-bit weighted code with weights 8,4,2,1:
```
Digit : BCD
0     : 0000
1     : 0001
2     : 0010
3     : 0011
4     : 0100
5     : 0101
6     : 0110
7     : 0111
8     : 1000
9     : 1001
```
Note: 1010–1111 are invalid in 8421 BCD.

### 4.2 Excess-3 (XS-3)
Excess-3 encodes decimal digits by adding a bias of 3:
XS-3(d) = binary(d + 3) for d ∈ {0..9}
```
Digit : XS-3
0     : 0011  (3)
1     : 0100  (4)
2     : 0101  (5)
3     : 0110  (6)
4     : 0111  (7)
5     : 1000  (8)
6     : 1001  (9)
7     : 1010  (10)
8     : 1011  (11)
9     : 1100  (12)
```
Key property: Self-complementing (the 9’s complement of a decimal digit corresponds to bitwise complement in XS-3 under certain arrangements), which is useful in subtraction methods.

### 4.3 BCD → Excess-3
Conceptually: add 3 (0011) to the BCD nibble for digits 0–9.
- Arithmetic implementation: Use a 4-bit adder with constant input 0011.
- Logic-minimized implementation: Derive per-output-bit K-maps from the truth table.



#### Truth Table

<img width="240" height="306" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd2d99a4-ead3-45bc-a741-f4a71cdb7be5" />

- Create K-maps for each E bit using only valid BCD entries (0–9).
- Mark invalid inputs 1010–1111 as don’t-cares (X) to help minimization.
  
#### K-map

<img width="541" height="523" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7425a991-380f-49d7-9ad4-714ab97e98c2" />

#### Logic Diagram

Hardware options:
- Adder-based (simplest to reason about; slightly more gate-heavy if no dedicated adders).
- Pure logic gates from minimized Boolean equations (can be smaller with don’t-cares).

### 4.4 Excess-3 → BCD
Conceptually: subtract 3 (0011) from each nibble.
- Arithmetic implementation: Add 1101 (i.e., +(-3) in 4-bit two’s complement with proper handling) or use adder with constant 1101 and ignore carry beyond 4 bits because digits are constrained.
- Pure logic: K-map each BCD output bit from XS-3 inputs for digits 3–12 mapped back to 0–9.

Important: Ensure inputs are valid XS-3 (0011 to 1100). Detect/flag invalid nibbles outside the 3–12 range.

### 4.5 Multi-digit numbers
Both BCD and XS-3 are per-digit codes. For decimal strings:
- Convert each digit separately.
- Concatenate 4-bit groups.
- Preserve leading zeros as necessary for fixed width hardware.

---

## 5) Other Numeric Codes (briefly)

### 5.1 2421 (weighted)
2421 is another weighted decimal code with digit mapping (some variants exist). Converters between 8421 ↔ 2421 are designed similarly:
- Build the truth table for digits 0–9.
- Use K-maps to derive equations.
- Use don’t-cares for invalid combinations to minimize.

### 5.2 5211, 6311 (and other weighted codes)
These are less common in basic curricula but the conversion method remains identical: truth table → K-map → minimal logic.

### 5.3 7-Segment Code (display-oriented)
Not strictly a “numeric code” for arithmetic, but widely used. Converter: BCD → 7-segment (a,b,c,d,e,f,g) lines.
- Build the truth table for segments ON/OFF for digits 0–9.
- Derive each segment’s logic with K-maps.
- Treat 10–15 as don’t-cares to minimize.

---

## 6) Design Methodology Step-by-Step (Example)

### Example A: 3-bit Binary → Gray
Inputs: B2 B1 B0; Outputs: G2 G1 G0
Equations (from XOR rules):
- G2 = B2
- G1 = B2 ⊕ B1
- G0 = B1 ⊕ B0

Gate-level:
- Wire B2 to G2.
- XOR(B2, B1) → G1.
- XOR(B1, B0) → G0.

Verification: Enumerate all 8 input combinations; check against Gray truth table.

### Example B: BCD → Excess-3 (Adder-based design)
Inputs: B3 B2 B1 B0 (8421 digit 0–9)
Outputs: E3 E2 E1 E0

Approach:
- Use a 4-bit ripple-carry adder.
- Connect B3..B0 to one input.
- Connect 0 0 1 1 (constant 3) to the other input.
- Result is E3..E0.

Note: For digits 7–9, BCD+3 exceeds 9 (10–12) but XS-3 allows 4-bit outputs (1010–1100). That’s expected and correct.

### Example C: Excess-3 → BCD (Logic-minimized)
Build mapping:
- XS-3 0011–1100 → digits 0–9 (subtract 3).
K-map each BCD output bit using don’t-cares for values outside XS-3 range.

---

## 7) Practical Considerations and Pitfalls

- Validity checks:
  - BCD must be 0000–1001; 1010–1111 are invalid.
  - XS-3 must be 0011–1100; outside values invalid.
  - Gray/Binary must be all 0/1 with correct width.

- Bit width and leading zeros:
  - Preserve width for hardware interfacing (e.g., 4-bit per decimal digit).

- Endianness and notation:
  - Always specify MSB→LSB order in the equations 

- Hazards and glitches:
  - Combinational converters with multiple product terms may exhibit dynamic hazards.
  - XOR networks (Gray converters) can still glitch if inputs change non-atomically.
  - Use proper synchronization (register inputs/outputs) in synchronous systems.

- Multi-digit cascading:
  - Converters like BCD ↔ XS-3 are per digit; do not treat the entire number as one binary word unless intended.
  - When chaining across digits (e.g., after arithmetic), ensure carry handling is per decimal digit where applicable (for BCD arithmetic, correction logic is needed; code conversion itself is per digit).

- Error handling:
  - Decide behavior for invalid inputs (saturate, flag error, map to X-state).
  - In safety-critical systems, add error detection logic.

---

## 8) Verification Strategy

- Exhaustive truth-table simulation for small widths (e.g., 3–4 bits).
- Random tests for larger widths; check round-trip conversions (Binary→Gray→Binary returns original).
- Formal verification (equivalence checking) for logic-minimized vs adder-based designs.
- Hardware testbenches (HDL) with timing analysis; check for hazards with staggered input transitions.

---

## 9) Implementation Options

- Gate-level (AND/OR/NOT/XOR) using minimized Boolean equations.
- Adder-based (for bias operations like Excess-3): a 4-bit adder with constants.
- Programmable logic (PLA/PAL) with the truth-table programmed.
- HDL (Verilog/VHDL) with synthesizable behavioral code:
  - Gray: continuous assignments with XORs.
  - XS-3: adder or case-statements; ensure synthesis maps efficiently.

---

## 10) Where each converter is useful

- Binary ↔ Gray: Position encoders, ADC stepping, asynchronous counters.
- BCD ↔ XS-3: Teaching complements and certain decimal arithmetic schemes; legacy systems.
- 8421 ↔ 2421 or other weighted codes: Specific logic optimizations or display encoding.
- BCD ↔ 7-segment: Human display of digits on LEDs/LCDs.

---

## 11) Practice Problems

1) Design a 3-bit Gray → Binary converter with only XOR gates. Verify against all 8 inputs.
2) Build the K-map for BCD→XS-3 E2 bit and derive its minimal expression using don’t-cares.
3) Implement XS-3→BCD using a 4-bit adder that adds 1101 (i.e., subtract 3). Show how invalid XS-3 inputs are detected.
4) Design 8421→2421 converter: Full truth table for digits 0–9, mark others as don’t-cares, derive equations.
5) BCD→7-segment: derive logic for segment ‘a’ and ‘d’ using K-maps.


---

## 12) Takeaways

- Gray converters are elegantly implemented with XOR chains.
- Excess-3 converters are best understood as “add/subtract 3 per digit”; implement with adders or minimized logic.
- Always enforce valid-input ranges and define behavior for invalid codes.
- Use K-map don’t-cares (invalid digits) to reduce gate count.
- Verify with round-trip conversions and hazard-aware timing checks in hardware.
